## Presentation talking points:

1. Brief intro into what are Deep Neural Nets **(Brandon)**
2. What are Spiking Neural Nets **(Brandon)**
3. What is LIF and how is it different from Integrate and Fire **(Brandon)**
3. Point about the spread between biological realsim and utility **(Arslan)**
4. Difference between ReLU and LeakySigmoid **(Arslan)**
5. Architecture of the SNN used **(Arslan)**
6. Dataset **(Erik)**
7. What part of the dataset were used **(Erik)**
8. What are the advantages of SNNs? **(Erik)**

10. Discuss these individually at the end. 
    - What did we learn?
    - How can we each individually apply it?
    - What was our new exposure
    - What is our actionable knowledge



|Biological Realism| Biologically plausible| Utility Based|
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
|Hodgkins-Huxley model of a neuron| Leaky Intergate-and-fire| ReLU|






*Notes:*

**Eric will make a LIF attempt**
