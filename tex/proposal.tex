\begin{abstract}
Use of Deep Neural Network, commonly referred to as
\textit{deep learning} spiked in recent years and has been used
as a tool for impressive advancements in the field of 
\textit{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
Spiking Neural Networks draw inspiration from the 
Purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of a 
Spiking Neural Network and compare it to a more conventional 
Object Recognition Deep Neural Network
