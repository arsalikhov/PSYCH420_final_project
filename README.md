## Final Project for PSYCH 420 (Intro to Computational Neuroscience)

The project originally aimed to implement a Deep Convolutional SNN model for object detection purposes. However, due to the depth of the model (pun intended), we decided to scale down the project to a showcase of snnTorch package and the difference between traditional CNN and Spiking neural networks.
